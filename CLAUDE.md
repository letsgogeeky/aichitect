# AIchitect — Project Context

**Brand:** "Cut the noise. Pick your AI stack."
**Domain:** aichitect.dev | **Stack:** Next.js 16 + React Flow + Three.js + Tailwind v4 + TypeScript

## Engineering philosophy

This is a greenfield project. Always build clean:

- **No adapter layers** — if the DB schema or TypeScript type is designed a certain way, the rest of the code conforms to it. Never write a mapping/transform function to bridge an old shape to a new one just to avoid touching other files.
- **No backwards-compat shims** — if a type changes, update all call sites. If a field is renamed, rename it everywhere. The cost of a clean sweep is low at this stage.
- **No workarounds** — if something is wrong, fix the root cause. Don't patch around it with defensive code, re-exports, or fallback casts that exist only to preserve a broken old shape.

The exception: once we have production data that can't be migrated cheaply, or a public API contract we can't break, we'll revisit. Until then, always reach for the clean solution.

## Dev workflow

- **Docker only** — never run `npm` or `node` locally. All dev runs through docker-compose.
- Use `make run` to start (foreground), `make down` to stop, `make rebuild` after adding packages.
- Hot reload via volume mounts. Rebuild image only when adding new packages to `package.json`.

## Git & PR workflow

**Branching:**

- Always branch from the current active branch: `git checkout -b feat/AIC-N`
- Ramy ensures the active branch is the correct base before starting — no merging or rebasing needed.

**Commits (Ramy signs — never commit for him):**

1. Stage specific files: `git add <files>`
2. Print the commit message for Ramy to copy
3. Ramy runs `git commit` — his signing config applies automatically
4. After Ramy confirms the commit, open the PR with `gh pr create`

**PR format (concise):**

- Title: `feat(scope): AIC-N — short description` (≤60 chars)
- Body: 3–5 bullet summary of what changed and why, plus a short test plan checklist
- No walls of text, no restating every file changed

## Architecture

```

### Component responsibility rules

Page-level client components (`GenomeClient`, `StacksClient`, `BuilderClient`) are thin shells — they wire state and layout but contain no business logic.

| Where                     | What                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hooks/`                  | URL-backed state, multi-piece state machines (`useBuilderState`, `useComparisonMode`) |
| `lib/`                    | Pure functions with no React dependency                                               |
| `app/<route>/components/` | Sub-components owned by a single route                                                |
| `components/`             | Shared components used across multiple routes                                         |

Keep individual files under ~300 lines. When a file grows beyond that, extract a component or hook.

## Data shape (tools.json)

```ts
{ id, name, category, tagline, description, type: "oss"|"commercial",
  pricing: { free_tier, plans[] }, github_stars, slot, prominent,
  website_url, github_url, choose_if, aliases, provider,
  health_score, last_synced_at, is_stale }
```

## Sharing system

Builder selections are URL-encoded as `?s=tool-id-1,tool-id-2,...`

- `app/builder/page.tsx` — uses `useSearchParams` + `useRouter` to read/write the `s` param; wrapped in `<Suspense>`
- `components/ui/Navbar.tsx` — "Share Stack" button copies `window.location.href` to clipboard, shows "Copied!" for 2s
- `app/builder/opengraph-image.tsx` — edge-runtime OG image generator; reads `?s=` param, renders tool pills on dark background
- `app/badge/route.ts` — edge-runtime SVG badge endpoint: `GET /badge?s=cursor,langgraph` → shields.io-style SVG

## Card design (ToolNode)

- Colored 2px top accent strip (full opacity when expanded, dimmed otherwise)
- **OSS tag**: `◆ Open Source` — green (#26de81), filled bg, shown whenever `type === "oss"`
- **Free Tier tag**: `✦ Free Tier` — teal (#00d4aa), filled bg, shown whenever `pricing.free_tier === true`
- Stars moved to top-right (next to category label)
- Plan price pill + "Visit ↗" link remain in bottom row (collapsed/expanded respectively)

## 3D Graph (ExploreGraph3D)

- Dynamically imported with `ssr: false` from ExploreGraph.tsx
- Wheel event interception at container level (capture phase) amplifies deltaY × 6 for responsive zoom
- d3 forces: `charge` with `strength(-60).distanceMax(150)`, `center` with `strength(0.8)`
- OrbitControls: `zoomSpeed = 3`, `enableDamping = true`, `dampingFactor = 0.08`
- Nodes: THREE.Sphere + SpriteText label above; selected node gets a ring
- Camera set to `z: 250` on first engine stop
